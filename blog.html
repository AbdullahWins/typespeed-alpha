          Question 1: Mention the difference between local storage and session
          storage
        </p>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          Answer: Both are mostly same with one major difference, local storage
          keeps data even if the session/browser is closed but session storage
          deletes the data when the session/browser closes.

          Question 2: What are the differences between block scope and global
          scope?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          Answer: Variables/elements in global scope can be accessed from
          anywhere in the code, but block scope elements can only be accessed by
          that piece of code inside that block.

          Question 3: How dose Javascript event loop work?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          Answer: The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to
          perform non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task is started,
          the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the
          event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be
          performed.
